### Ultra-Marathon Races Analysis

This project provides an in-depth examination of athlete performance metrics across various races, with a specific focus on seasonal variations. Using the comprehensive dataset from [Kaggle's Big Dataset of Ultra Marathon Running](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/discussion/420633), the project embarks on a detailed exploration of how average speeds of athletes fluctuate throughout the year. The analysis involves several key steps, including meticulous data cleaning, feature engineering to categorize races by seasons, and statistical aggregation to identify performance trends.
The dataset is processed using Python, with libraries such as pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for creating insightful visualizations.
Through this detailed analysis, the project aims to provide valuable insights for athletes, coaches, and sports analysts to optimize training schedules, plan races strategically, and ultimately enhance performance outcomes.
