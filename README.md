**Ultra Marathon Runners Analysis Project**

This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset on ultra marathon runners, providing insights into various aspects of these endurance events. The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/discussion/420633), includes detailed information on race times, participant demographics, and environmental conditions. Key features of this project include:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis by handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends and patterns in ultra marathon performance across different races and demographic groups.
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Providing actionable insights for runners, coaches, and event organizers to improve training and race planning.

By leveraging this rich dataset, the project aims to enhance the understanding of ultra marathon running dynamics and contribute valuable findings to the endurance sports community.
